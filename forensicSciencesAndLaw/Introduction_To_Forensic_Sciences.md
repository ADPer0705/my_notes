**Forensic Science** is the investigation, explanation, and evaluation of events of  legal relevance, using scientific methodologies and their inference to reconstruct events from fragmentary evidences and other relevant information from and beyond the crime scene 

- derived from the latin word "*Forensis*" which means public discussion or debate 
- The application of scientific knowledge to supply accurate and objective information reflecting the events that occurred at a crime 
- The application of scientific knowledge to legal problems 

# Scope and Need of Forensic Sciences
- There is an urgent need for the application of forensic science in the criminal justice delivery system.
- There are a large number of trials, criminal proceedings in heinous (serious) crimes, which end in acquittals.
- Large number of cases still pending in various courts in India for disposal. So, there is a necessity of evidences to prove somebody guilty or exoneration of the innocents.
- Reason - lack of proper evidences.
- Witnesses turn hostile
- The eyewitnesses may not be reliable sometimes because of the credibility. This may lead to the complication of the delivery of the justice.

# A Brief History

## Forensic in Indian Literature
- *Arthashastra* : Ancient Indian sanskrit treatise that includes records on the nature of governments, law, civil and criminal systems 
- Fingerprints were used by the ancient kingdom of South India. 
	- They named the handprints as *Tarija* and considered them unique. 
	- It is believed that the Indian ancestors had the knowledge about the persistency and individuality of fingerprints 

## Fiction and Fame 
- Forensic Science garnered attention when *Sir Arthur Conan Doyle* penned down a fictional character *Sherlock Holmes* 
	- The book documented principles of serology, fingerprint identification, firearm examination and many more aspects of forensic science practiced today 
	- His *Sir Arthur Conan Doyle*'s first novel was published in *Beeton's Christmas Annual*, under the title *A study in Scarlet* which introduced us to the immortal *Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson* 

# Principles of Forensic Science
Forensic Sciences incorporates principles of basic sciences like biology, physics, chemistry, medicine, etc. for justice delivery system. It deems that one cannot imitate nature and natural phenomenon 


> [!NOTE] 
> It deems that one cannot imitate nature and natural phenomenon

There are 7 basic principles/laws of forensic sciences
1. Law of Individuality 
2. Law of exchange 
3. Law of Progressive change 
4. Law of Comparison
5. Law of Analysis 
6. Law of Probability
7. Law of Circumstantial Facts 

## Law of Individuality 
*Every object, natural or man-made, has an individuality which is not duplicated in any other object or in any other words. No two things in this universe are alike*

- Every individual artifact, natural or man made, has a distinct quality or characteristic which is not duplicated in any other form
- There are small flaws in the materials, generated through various means of imperfections or due to inclusion of some extraneous matter. These individual characteristics can be useful in distinguishing intra and inter batch variations
- Law of individuality has fundamental importance and form the basis for forensic identification, establishing the link between crime and the criminal 

## Law of Exchange 
French scientist *Edmond Locard* gave the principle that 
*Every Contact Leaves a Trace*
When the perpetrator gets into contact with the victim of the items around him, they leave traces, likewise the criminal or his weapons picks up traces in the same way 

- **Point of entry** footsteps, fingerprints, etc. marks
- **At Crime Scene** While committing a crime the criminal might break a glass, leaves marks over some wooden surface, damages the door while trying to break the lock, etc.
- **Point of Exit** criminal is most likely to leave or carry some minute traces for example, exiting footprints, although this is very unlikely

## Law of Progressive Change
*Everything changes with the passage of time*

- The criminal undergoes several progressive changes with time 
- If he is not apprehended in time, he becomes unrecognizable except perhaps through his fingerprints, bone fractures or  any other characteristics of permanents nature
- The scene of crime also undergoes rapid change 
- The evidence involved in crime may be affected by external conditions
Thus the principle of progressive change demands prompt action while processing the evidence so as to maintain the integrity on crime scene 
## Law of Comparison 
*Only the likes can be compared*

- It emphasizes the necessity to provide like/similar type of samples and specimens for comparison with the questioned items 
- examples :- Murder cases, contested document cases, hair analysis, etc.

## Law of Analysis
*The analysis can be no better than the sample analysed*

- Improper sampling, contamination render the best analysis useless
- Emphasizes the necessity of proper collection of sample  for effectiveness 
- Samples to be analysed should be void of any contamination and with sufficient sample quantity

## Law of Probability 
*All conclusion, definite or indefinite, are made on the basis of probability*
- Chances of occurrence of any event at the scene of crime can be best described in terms of probability percentage
- All conclusion are probabilistic, nothing can be taken as granted

*P.S.* mention the definition and formulation of probability if seems necessary

## Law of Circumstantial Facts 
*Facts don't lie, men can and do*
Hence the importance of circumstantial evidence vis-a-vis oral evidence 

- The oral testimony depends upon the power of observation, assimilation and reproduction of the witness 
- hence dependence on the oral evidence is placed in accordance with the observations of eyewitnesses
- It can be modified by external influence, suggestion, opinions of others and rationality 
- Oral evidence is therefore colored whereas factual evidences is free from these infirmities

# Application of Forensic Science
Forensic science has become an essential part of the judicial system, as it utilizes a broad spectrum of sciences to achieve information relevant to criminal and legal evidence.

The ultimate aim of Forensic Scientist is to answer prime questions like :
- Who committed the crime? / Who is Victim?
- What is the modus-operandi of the crime
- When was the crime committed
- Origin of the crime scene 
- What are the evidences available on the body of at the crime scene 

Forensic science may prove the existence of a crime, the perpetrator of a crime, or a connection to a crime through the : 
- Examination of physical evidence 
- Administration of tests
- Interpretation of data 
- Clear and concise reporting 
- Truthful testimony of a forensic scientist

# Advancements in Investigation 


| **POLICE**                                                                                                                                           | **FORENSICS**                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Police investigators rely on the *Trace, Interview and Eliminate (TIE)*, basically Track, Question and Identify process to identify innocent parties | With Forensic evidence if is easier to eliminate people from the TIE prosecution due to its objectivity and precision |
| The action of police at a crime scene can affect the availability and efficacy of forensic tests later in the investigation                          | Any evidence removed from a scene by investigators must be packaged and labelled correctly to prevent contamination   |
| The purpose of crime scene management is to control, preserve, record and recover evidence from the scene of an incident                             | It is sometimes useful to bring the forensic specialists to the crime scene itself                                    |
