**Golden Rule of Criminal Investigation**
*Do not touch, alter, move, or transfer any object at the crime scene unless it is properly marked, measured, sketched and/or photographed* 

**Forensic Science**
- The application of scientific technology to supply accurate and objective information reflecting the events that occurred at a crime scene 
- The application of scientific knowledge to legal problems 

The following concepts are important in all forensic sciences 
1. **Chain of Custody** 
Maintaining proper chain of custody involves *producing and maintaining written documentation which accompanies the evidence and provides an uninterrupted timeline showing the secure location of the evidence from the time that it was discovered until the present time*
- The first issue of concern involves maintaining the proper "chain of custody" while dealing with evidences 
- Evidences of whatever type must be carefully and properly documented and evaluated 
- Because of the nature of certain types of evidence it cannot be collected and preserved indefinitely  
- Any transfer of evidence from one person or secure location to another must be documented. 
- Maintaining proper chain of custody helps to ensure that the evidence has not been contaminated or compromised in any way 
- If the proper 'Chain of Custody' is not maintained, the breaking of the chain may as well provide a potential reason for such evidence to be inadmissible in court 

2. **Admissibility of Tests, Evidence and Testimony**
- The second issue of concern that crosses all fields of forensic science involves the existence of legal standards for the admissibility of forensics tests and expert testimony 
- One legal standard for the admissibility of forensic tests is *Frye v United States*, which states that the forensic technique must have "general acceptance" by the scientific community 

3. **Expert Witness** 
- The third issue that relates to all forensic science disciplines is the concept of the expert witness 
- In contrast to a "fact witness", who is usually one able to relate the facts of the issue at hand as he/she observed them, an "expert witness", because of his/her specific expertise within a particular discipline, is also able to offer opinions regarding issues that relate to the specific discipline 
- In order to be recognized as an expert witness, the witness must be officially qualified or recognized as an expert, by the court
