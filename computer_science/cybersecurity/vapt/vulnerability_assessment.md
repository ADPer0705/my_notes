**Vulnerability Assessment** is the process of identifying and quantifying known security vulnerabilities in an environment. It indicates the weaknesses as well as provides the appropriate mitigation procedures required to either eliminate those weaknesses or reduce them to an acceptable level of risk 

Vulnerability Assessment is a step by step process :
1. Identifying Vulnerabilities 
	- we can use open source or commercial tools like nmap, openvas, nessusm, etc.
2. The Vulnerabilities are evaluated to estimate the risk posed by them
	- Vulnerability management solutions will provide different risk ratings and scores for vulnerabilities such as Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 
3. Treating the vulnerability 
	- Once the vulnerability has been validated and deemed a risk the next step is to treat that vulnerability 
	- There are different ways including : 
		- remediation
		- mitigation 
		- acceptance 
4. reporting the vulnerability
	- At last the vulnerability are reported for protecting other systems by resolving the vulnerabilities in a similar way

## Popular Vulnerability Assessment tools 

### nmap
- network mapper 
- linu-cli tool 
- used to scan IP addresses and ports in a network and to detect installed applications 
- nmap allows network admins to find 
	- which devices are running on their network 
	- discover open ports and services 
	- detect vulnerabilities
