		demonstrating a commitment to ethical conduct in software development.

#### Engineers in the fulfillment of their professional duties shall:
1. **Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public** 
	- When designing a new operating system, computer engineers must ensure that the software is secure against cyber threats. 
		- This involves implementing rigorous testing protocols to identify and fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited to harm users, such as by stealing personal information or damaging hardware.
2. **Perform services only in areas of their competence** 
	- A computer engineer specializing in network security should not take on projects designing artificial intelligence systems unless they have the necessary training and experience in AI. 
	- Taking on such projects without the proper expertise could lead to substandard results that might jeopardize the project's success and safety
3. **Issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner** 
	- If a computer engineer is asked about the security features of a new software product they helped develop, they should provide a truthful and objective assessment of its capabilities and limitations, avoiding exaggerated claims about its security that could mislead users and stakeholders.
4. **Act for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees**
	- A computer engineer tasked with upgrading a company's IT infrastructure must recommend the best solutions according to the client's needs and budget, not the solutions that would yield the highest profit margin for the engineer or their employer
5. **Avoid deceptive acts**
	- A computer engineer must not claim that a new app they are developing is fully functional and bug-free during a presentation to potential investors if there are still significant unresolved issues. 
	- Such deceptive acts could lead to financial losses and damage the reputation of all involved parties.
6. **Conduct themselves honorably, responsibly, ethically, and lawfully** 
	- A computer engineer discovers a colleague intentionally introducing backdoors into software being developed for a client. The engineer has a duty to report this unethical behavior to their superiors or relevant authorities, despite potential backlash, to uphold the law and ethical standards of the profession.

# Plagiarism
- It involves taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own. 
- It is considered an ethical breach and can have serious consequences in academic, professional, and creative contexts.

Examples of Copyright Protection:
1. **Preventing Unauthorized Reproduction** 
	- An author writes a novel. 
	- Copyright prevents others from reprinting and selling the novel without the author's permission.
2. **Publishing and Selling** 
	- A music producer holds the copyright to a music album. 
	- This allows them to control the manufacturing and selling of the album.
3. **Public Performance** 
	- A playwright has the copyright to a play. 
	- They can grant licenses for theaters to perform the play publicly and charge admission.
4. **Film Adaptation** 
	- A filmmaker obtains the rights to adapt a book into a movie. 
	- Without these rights, creating and distributing the film would infringe on the copyright
5. **Translation** 
	- A publisher wants to translate a popular foreign novel into another language. They must obtain permission from the copyright holder to legally publish the translation
6. **Adaptation**
	- A video game developer wishes to create a game based on a comic book series. They need to secure rights from the copyright holder to use the characters and story-lines

#### Copyright in Computer Engineering includes:
- Source code of software applications
- System architecture designs
- Technical documentation and manuals
- Databases and their structures
- Computer algorithms

#### Example of Copyright and Plagiarism
Consider an engineer named Raj who develops a unique algorithm for data encryption. Raj writes a paper detailing the algorithm and publishes it along with the source code under a specific copyright license that allows others to use the algorithm for academic purposes but not for commercial use without permission.
- **Copyright Violation**
	- If another developer, Aryan, takes Raj's source code, incorporates it into a commercial software product, and sells it without obtaining permission or giving credit, Aryan is violating Raj's copyright.
- **Plagiarism**
	- Suppose Rahul, another engineer, writes a paper on encryption techniques and includes Raj's algorithm in the paper, presenting it as Rahul's own invention without citing Raj's original work. This act constitutes plagiarism, as it involves taking someone else's intellectual creation (the encryption algorithm and its explanation) and passing it off as one's own.

#### Preventing Plagiarism and Respecting Copyright in Computer Engineering
- **Use Open Source Correctly** 
	- When using open-source software or code, adhere to the licensing terms, including attribution and restrictions on use.
- **Cite Sources** 
	- When discussing algorithms, code, or any intellectual property created by others in papers, reports, or software documentation, properly attribute the original creators.
- **Obtain Permissions** 
	- If you wish to use someone else's copyrighted work beyond the scope allowed by the license or law (e.g., fair use), obtain explicit permission from the copyright holder


#### Plagiarism Can either be Intentional or Unintentional
##### Intentional plagiarism
when someone deliberately tries to pass off someone else's work as their own. 
This can involve:
1. Copying and pasting text from a source without quotation marks or citations.
2. Paraphrasing someone else's work without attribution.
3. Purchasing a pre-written paper and submitting it as your own.
4. Submitting someone else's work (like a friend's paper) as your own.

Example of intentional plagiarism:
- A student finds a research paper online that perfectly matches their assignment topic. Instead of summarizing the information and citing the source, they simply copy and paste entire paragraphs into their own paper without quotation marks or any mention of the original author.

##### Unintentional plagiarism
It happens when someone unintentionally fails to give credit for someone else's work. 
This can be due to:
- **Poor paraphrasing** 
	- Changing a few words in a source without truly understanding or rephrasing the concept.
- **Incorrect citation** 
	- Missing important information in the citation, making it difficult to trace the original source.
- **Not knowing citation guidelines** 
	- Being unfamiliar with how to properly cite sources in a particular style (e.g., MLA, APA).

Example of unintentional plagiarism:
- A student reads a book for research and takes notes while highlighting key passages. When writing their assignment, they accidentally include some of the highlighted passages in their own words without properly citing the source.
