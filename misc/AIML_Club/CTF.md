# Walkthrough of the development of a model 

Potential questions, in terms or various steps of and ai/ml model development process : 
- Defining the Problem statement
	- what input features seems necessary ?
	- The target variable
- Data Collection
	- provide messy or incomplete data files and ask participants to clean and integrate them
- Data Exploration and Preprocessing
	- Give a datasets with hidden issues (missing values, categorical columns) and ask to preprocess 
- Feature Engineering 
	- Provide a dataset and ask participants to generate meaningful features 
- Model Selection
	- ask participants to analyze the data and suggest the best model for the given problem 
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
	- based on model prediction compute the evaluation metrics
- Model Deployment
- Model Monitoring
	- detect biases present
