*Should all the crime scenes be processed in the same manner or not ?
The answer is NO*

- The irony is, although crime scene processing is a structured, scientific, and orderly process, the crime scene is one of the most chaotic, unpredictable, and variable environments 
- Every reported crime is different, every scene is unique, every component may be an important variable, and all of this affects the investigatorâ€™s ability to apply the science of crime scene investigation to the scene itself
- Investigators must therefore balance the theory behind these processes with logic, reasoning, and the reality of resources available 
- These factors determine how closely they can adhere to the best practices of crime scene investigation i.e. the scientific method 
- The application of the scientific method to crime scene processing involves one key factor : *The inclusion of duelling* or *Competing Hypothesis*

## What is Competing Hypothesis ?
- The concept behind competing hypothesis is *to disprove something*
- The aim is to combat the tendency to favour one explanation from the beginning, and to focus on evidence that is inconsistent rather than consistent with the hypothesis

## Example : A Murder Scene
 - When we enter the death scene, we might see the dead person with a single gunshot wound to the head, the apparent weapon by his side 
 - There can be two competing hypothesis :
	 1. Suicide
	 2. Homicide 
- As we process the scene, we intentionally search for what prove both hypothesis to be accurate 
- We  ensure to collect all the evidence that supports our initial assumption and also the evidences that challenges them 
- At the end of this process we'll have a collection of evidences that either proves or disproves our each hypothesis


| **Suicide**                          | **Homicide**                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| No sign of forced entry              | Sign of forced entry                |
| Only descendant's prints on the gun  | Sign of struggle within the scene   |
| Contact or near-contact wounds       | Defensive wounds on descendant      |
| Suicide note or indicative behaviors | Gunshot residue on hands of suspect |
| Motivating factor for suicide        | No motivation for suicide           |

## Role of Competing Hypothesis in Sexual Assault Investigation and Prosecution 
- In sexual assault investigation, it is critical to note that 
	1. neither the victim's statement is immediately accepted as true (or dismissed as false)
	2. nor the suspect's statement is immediately dismissed as false (or accepted as true)

**#StartByBelieving**
It is the global campaign transforming the way we respond to sexual assault
- The interview of each person should begin from an orientation of "Start by Believing"
- A scientific approach with competing hypothesis can help prevent an investigator's action from showing favor to one person over another (either knowingly or unknowingly)
- These are generally based on gender stereotypes or misunderstanding about the real dynamics or sexual assault crimes 
- This will also help prepare the investigator and prosecutor to address defense arguments if the case goes to trial
