### Kohlberg's stages of moral development 
1. Obedience and Punishment Orientations
	- moral decisions are based on fear of punishment and obedience to authority figures 
	- e.g. A child not stealing a cookie due to the fear of punishment from the mother
2. Individualism and Exchange
	- In this stage individuals consider their own interests and the interests of others, focusing on reciprocity and self-interest 
	- e.g. A child sharing his lunch with a classmate expecting a return of favour 
3. Interpersonal Relationships
	- At this stage an individual seeks approval and maintain social relationships, making moral decisions based on the societal norms and being perceived as a good person
	- Here being "peer approved" has a bit more edge over being totally just and following the rules 
	- e.g. A teenager might think of helping a friend even if it requires breaking or bending around rules, because 'It is important to be a good friend'
4. Maintaining Social Order 
	- At this stage, moral decisions prioritize societal rules, laws and the maintenance or order often guided by loyalty to the social group and respect for authority 
	- e.g. An adult not protesting against a law he or she disagrees with, and instead taking a more diplomatic or formal approach, considering the importance of maintaining the social order, which he or she considers is essential for the functioning of the society 
5. Social Contract and Individual Rights 
	- At this stage the moral decisions are based on the sense of fairness, justice and respect for individual rights, even if it means opposing societal norms and laws
	- e.g. A person supporting or protesting in favour of free speech, standing against censorship, because he or she supports the individual's right to freely express one's emotions and feeling and opinions 
6. Universal Principles 
	- This can be considered as the 'Final Stage' in the process of moral development. Here the moral decisions are based purely on the basis of true sense of justice, equality and human rights. The person at this stage goes beyond peer approval, societal norms and individualism.
	- e.g. A person refusing to participate in a war, even if the law mandates the participation, because it is against his or her commitment to principles of peace and human harmony
