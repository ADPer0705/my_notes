The **Authentication Header Protocol** 
- provides data integrity and authentication 
- does not provide encryption, therefore it does not provide confidentiality 
AH was designed to be inserted into an IP packet to add authentication data and protect the contents from modification 

This protocol is now obsolete and supported by only legacy applications
