# Importance of Business Continuity
The intent of a BC plan is to sustain business operations while recovering from a significant disruption

A key part of the plan is communication, including multiple contact methodologies and backup numbers in case of a disruption of power or communications. Many organizations will establish a phone tree, so that if one person is not available, they know who else to call. Management must be included, because sometimes priorities may change depending on the situation. Individuals with proper authority must be there to execute operations, for instance, if there are critical areas that need to be shut down

# Components of a BC Plan
Business continuity planning (BCP) is the proactive development of procedures to restore business operations after a disaster
Here are some common components of a comprehensive business continuity plan
- List of the BCP team members, including multiple contact methods and backup members
- Immediate response procedures and checklists (security and safety procedures, fire suppression procedures, notification of appropriate emergency-response agencies, etc.)
- Notification systems and call trees for alerting personnel that the BCP is being enacted
- Guidance for management, including designation of authority for specific managers
- How/when to enact the plan
- Contact numbers for critical members of the supply chain (vendors, customers, possible external emergency providers, third-party partners)
