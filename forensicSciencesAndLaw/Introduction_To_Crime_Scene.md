**Crime Scene Processing** is a systematic, meticulous, and scientific process that law enforcement investigators should employ in every major criminal investigation 
- The process is used to document and preserve a location where criminal activity is known or is suspected to have occurred 
- It facilitates the location and recovery of physical evidences to help prove the elements of an offense
- It generates information that helps outline individual investigation steps and an overall investigation plan
- It facilitates the identification of participants, such as witnesses and suspects 

# Crime Scene Investigation 

*Crime scene investigation* can be defined as a legal, purposeful, planned and systematic process, conducted by competent investigators 

The tenet that physical evidence can provide linkage to people, places or things is based upon *Locard's Exchange principle*
#Locard_Exchange_Principle 

**The goal of a crime scene investigation** is to :
- search for,
- discover,
- protect,
- document,
- collect,
- package,
- label,
- preserve, and
- transmit physical evidence 
associated with a suspected criminal event to a forensic science facility for safekeeping and eventual scientific examination and analysis
