**Forensic Science** is the investigation, explanation, and evaluation of events of  legal relevance including the identity, origin and life history of 

# Principles of Forensic Science
There are 7 basic principles/laws of forensic sciences
1. Law of Individuality 
2. Law of exchange 
3. Law of Progressive change 
4. Law of Comparison
5. Law of Analysis 
6. Law of Probability
7. Law of Circumstantial Facts 

## Law of Individuality 
*Every object, natural or man-made, has an individuality which is not duplicated in any other object or in any other words. No two things in this universe are alike*

- There are small flaws in the materials, generated through various means of imperfections or due to inclusion of some extraneous matter. These individual characteristics can be useful in distinguishing intra and inter batch variations
- Law of individuality has fundamental importance and form the basis for forensic identification, establishing the link between crime and the criminal 

## Law of Exchange 
*Every Contact Leaves a Trace*

- **Point of entry** footsteps, fingerprints, etc. marks
- **At Crime Scene** While committing a crime the criminal might break a glass, leaves marks over some wooden surface, damages the door while trying to break the lock, etc.
- **Point of Exit** criminal is most likely to leave or carry some minute traces for example, exiting footprints, although this is very unlikely

## Law of Progressive Change
*Everything changes with the passage of time*

- The criminal undergoes several progressive changes with time 
- If he is not apprehended in time, he becomes unrecognizable except perhaps through his fingerprints, bone fractures or  any other characteristics of permanents nature
- The scene of crime also undergoes rapid change 
- The evidence involved in crime may be affected by external conditions

## Law of Comparison 
*Only the likes can be compared*

- It emphasizes the necessity to provide like/similar type of samples and specimens for comparison with the questioned items 

## Law of Analysis
*The analysis can-be no better than the sample analysed*

- Improper sampling, contamination render the best analysis useless
- Emphasizes the necessity of collecting proper sample and properly packed for effectivity 

## Law of Probability 
- All conclusion are probabilistic, nothing can be taken as granted

## Law of Circumstantial Facts 
*Facts don't lie*

- The dependence on the oral evidence is placed in accordance with the observations of eyewitnesses
