Operating Systems : software that manages a computer's hardware, provides basis for application programs, and act as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware. 

# What Operating Systems Do
A computer system can be divided roughly into four components:
1. the hardware
	- provides the base computing resources for the system
2. the operating system
	- define the ways in which these resources are used to solve user's computing problems
3. the application programs
4. a user

Like a government, the OS controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for the various users. It performs no useful function by itself. It simply provides an *environment* within which other programs can do useful work.

- user's view
	- ease of use
	- some systems (e.g. embedded computers) have little to no user view
- system view
	- resource allocator 
	- A control program
		- manages the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer

Most computers have two modes of operation: *kernel mode* and *user mode*. The OS, being the most fundamental piece of software, runs in kernel mode.
- complete access to all the hardware and can execute any instruction the machine is capable of executing. 
The rest of the software runs in user mode, in which 
- only a subset of the machine instructions is available.
