short for "**malicious software**", 
- refers to any *intrusive software* developed by cyber-criminals to steal data and damage or destroy computers and computer systems

Malware can be detected by observing some common symptoms of your machines. These symptoms may include 
- the slow speed of your computer or web browser over a period of few days. or a week
- frequent freezing or crashing of the system,
- modified or deleted files
- the sudden creation of new programs or desktop icons without your knowledge 
- programs running and without your consent 
- changes in messages being sent without you permission 
- pop-up advertisements 
- browser links redirect to the wrong web-page
	etc.

The process of malware making it's way onto your device is relatively simple :
- A hacker plans and places a malicious link, file, or attachment in front of their victim
	- potentially a phishing email via social engineering tactics
- the victim clicks on the infected asset, unknowingly triggering the malware to install onto their device 
- The malware proceeds to steal, compromise, and/or destroy sensitive data stored on the device

Common types of malware are :
- Virus
- Worms
- Trojans
- Ransomware
- Botnets
- Adware
- Spyware
- Rootkits 
- Fireless Malware
- Malvertising 
etc.

- **VIRUS**
	- a malicious software attached to a document or file that supports macros to execute its code and spread from host to host 
	- once downloaded, the virus will *lay dormant until the file is opened and in use* 
	- Viruses are designed to disrupt a system's ability to operate 
	- As a result, viruses can cause significant operational issues and data loss 
- **WORMS**
	- malicious software that rapidly replicates and spread to any device within the network 
	- Unlike viruses, worms do not need host programs to disseminate 
	- A worm infects a device via a downloaded file or a network connection before it multiplies and disperses at an exponential rate 
	- Like viruses worms can severely disrupt the operations of a device and cause data loss 
- **TROJAN**
	- Trojan viruses are disguised as helpful software programs.
	- once the user downloads it, the trojan virus can gain access to sensitive data and then modify, block, or delete the data 
	- This can be extremely harmful to the performance of the device 
	- Unlike normal viruses and worms, Trojan viruses are not designed to self-replicate 
- **RANSOMWARE**
	- malicious software that gains access to sensitive information within a system, encrypts that information so that the user cannot access it, and then demands a financial payout for the data to be released 
	- it is commonly a part of a phishing scam 
	- when the attacker receives the payment, the data may or may not be blocked 
- **BOT**
	- a software program that performs an automated task without requiring any interaction. 
	- A computer with a bot infection can spread the bot to other devices, creating a *botnet*
	- This network of bot-compromised machines can then be controlled and used to launch massive attack by hackers, often without the device owner being aware of its role in the attack 
- **ADWARE**
	- malicious software used to collect data on your computer usage and provide appropriate advertisements to you.
	- while adware is not always dangerous, in some cases adware can cause issues for your system 
	- adware can redirect your browser to unsafe sites, and it can even contain trojan horses and spyware 
	- significant amount of adware can also slow down the system noticeably 
	- because not all adware are malicious, it is important to have protection that constantly and intelligently scans these programs 
- **SPYWARE**
	- malicious software that runs secretly on a computer and reports back to a remote user 
	- rather than simply disrupting a device's operations, spyware targets sensitive information and can grant remote access to predators 
	- spyware is often used to steal financial or personal information 
	- A specific type of spyware is a *keylogger*, which records your keystrokes to reveal passwords and personal information 
- **ROOTKIT**
	- type of malware designed to give hackers access to and control over a target device 
	- although most rootkits affect the software and the operating system, some can also infect your computer's hardware and firmware 
	- they are adept in concealing their presence, but while they remain hidden, they are active 
	- once they gain access, they enable cyber-criminals to steal personal data and financial information, install malware, or use computers as part of a botnet to circulate spam and participate in DDoS attacks
- **FILE-LESS MALWARE**
	- a type of malware that uses legitimate programs to infect a computer 
	- It does not rely on files and leaves no footprints, making it challenging to detect and remove 
	- They use techniques like exploit kits, memory only malware, stolen credentials. etc.
- **MALVERTISING**
	- use of online advertising to spread and install malware or redirect your traffic
	- cyber-criminals inject infected ads into legitimate advertising networks that display ads on websites you trust
