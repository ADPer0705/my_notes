Each digital device is assigned an IP and this is what enables us to communicate and connect with it.
- IP address is the logical address of a machine
- the scope of the logical address is world wide 
	- no two machines in the world can have the same IPs
- The address in TCP/IP protocol suite is defined in the network layer packets during the communication.
