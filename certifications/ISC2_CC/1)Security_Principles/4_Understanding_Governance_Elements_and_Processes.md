# Governance Elements
Any business or organisation exists to fulfill a purpose. To complete the objective requires that decision are made, rules and practices are defined, and policies and procedures are in place to guide the organization in its pursuit of achieving its goals and mission 

When leaders and management implement the systems and structures that the organisation will adhere to, they're guided by laws and regulations created by governments to enact public policy. Laws and regulations guide the development of standards, which cultivate policies, which result in procedures 

regulations, procedures, standards and policies are related in the following way :
- *Procedures* are the detailed steps to complete a task that supports departmental or organisational policies 
- *Policies* are put in place by organisational governance, such as executive management, to provide guidance in all activities to ensure that the organization supports industry standards and regulations 
- *Standards* are often used by governance teams to provide a framework to introduce policies and procedures in support of regulations 
- *Regulations* are commonly issued in the form of laws, usually from government (not to be confused with governance) and typically carry financial penalties for non-compliance

## Regulations and Laws
Regulations and associated fines and penalties can be imposed by governments at the national, regional or local level, and these can be imposed and enforced differently in different parts of the world.

Here are a few examples of actual regulations 
- The **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996** is an example of a law that governs the use of *protected health Information (PHI)* in the United States
	- Violation of HIPAA rules carries the possibility of fines and/or imprisonment for both individuals and companies 
- The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** was enacted by the European Union to control use of *Personally Identifiable Information (PII)* of its citizens and those living in the EU even if the company who handle data of EU citizens and those living in the EU even if the company does not have a physical presence in the EU, giving this regulation an international reach 

It is common to be subject to regulations on several levels, consider a multinational organisation, those are subject to regulations in more than one nation in addition to multiple regions and municipalities. Organisations need to consider the regulation that apply to their business at all levels and ensure they are compliant with the most restrictive regulations 

## Standards 
Organisations use *multiple standards* as part of their information systems security program, *both as compliance documents and as advisories of guidelines*. Standards cover a broad range of issues and ideas and may provide assurance that an organisation is operating with policies and procedures that support regulation and are widely accepted best practices 

- The *International Organisation for Standardization (ISO)* develops and publishes international standards on a variety of technical subjects, including information systems and information security, as well as encryption standards 
	- ISO solicits input from the international community of experts to provide input on its standards prior to publishing
- The *National Institute of Technology (NIST)* is a United States government agency under the department of Commerce and publishes a variety of technical standards in addition to information technology and information security standards 
	- These standards solicit and integrate input from the industry
	- Many of the standards issued by NIST are requirements for U.S. Government agencies and are considered recommended standards by industries worldwide 

There are standards established that enable the global communication between various computers
- Thanks to the *Internet Engineering Task Force (IETS)*, there are standards in communication protocols that ensure all computers can connect with each other across borders 
- The *Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)* also sets standards for telecommunication, computer engineering and similar concepts 

## Policies 
- It is informed by applicable laws and specifies which standards and guidelines the organisation will follow 
- It is broad but not detailed 
- Establishes context and sets out strategic directions and priorities 
- Governance policies are used to moderate and control decision-making, to ensure compliance when necessary and to guide the creation and implementation of other policies 

- often written at many levels 
	- high-level governance policies are used by senior executives to shape and control decision-making processes 
	- other high-level policies direct behavior and activity of the entire organization 
	- Functional areas such as human resources management, finance and accounting, and security and asset protection usually have their own set of policies 
- Whether imposed by laws and regulations, or by contracts, the need for compliance might also require the development of specific high-level policies that are documented and assessed for their effective use 

- policies must be expanded from statements of intent to step by step instructions, since they're to be implemented by people 

## Procedures 
- define the explicit, repeatable activities necessary to accomplish a specific task or set of tasks 
- they provide supporting data, decision criteria, or other explicit knowledge needed to perform each task
- They can address either a infrequent or a common action 
- In addition, procedures establish the measurement criteria and methods to use to determine whether a task has been successfully completed 
- Properly documenting procedures and training personnel on how to locate and follow them is necessary for deriving the maximum organizational benefits
