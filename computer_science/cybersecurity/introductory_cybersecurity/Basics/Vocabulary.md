# Enumeration
It is the process of gathering information on a target in order to find potential attack vectors and aid in exploitation 

This process is for an attack to be successful, as wasting time with exploits that either don't work or can crash the system can be a waste of energy. 

Enumeration can be used to gather usernames, passwords, network information , hostname, application data, services, or any other information that may be valuable to an attacker
