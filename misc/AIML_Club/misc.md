Hello Everyone,
The google groups have been updated as of now, and I suggest the following course of action, keeping in mind the ongoing discussions
1. I believe we should now close the google form, it's time we get going
2. I'll draft an email, 
	1. the activities are starting again
	2. for those who joined lates, the dates have been extended
	3. for others, new tasks have been assigned
	4. share the links for whatsapp and datacamp again at the end
3. assign the next tasks in both the tracks, foundational and data science

apart from these let's keep looking into the activities for the offline meet

seems alright ???
