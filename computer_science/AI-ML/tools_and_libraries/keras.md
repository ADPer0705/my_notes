**Keras** is a high-level Deep Learning API that makes it very simple to train and run neural networks. It can run on top of either TensorFlow, Theano, or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly known as CNTK). TensorFlow comes with its own implementation of this API, called *tf.keras*, which provides support for some advanced TensorFlow features (e.g. the ability to efficiently load data)
