## Who is considered a first responder in a crime scene ?
- The first person to arrive at a scene and observe it in its most pristine state is referred to as the *First Responder*
- Depending on how the crime or emergency is communicated with the authorities, it is usually one of the following three :
	1. Police officers
	2. Fire Department 
	3. Emergency Medical Personnel 

# Arriving at the crime scene 
The initial responding officers who arrive at the crime scene should take care and account for the following points 

## 1.) Respond with Caution 
- Officers who arrive at a crime scene must be cautious and methodical 
- They should strive to preserve the scene with minimal contamination and should not disturb physical evidence 

### The responding Officer(s) should :
- Note or log dispatch information (e.g. address / location, time and date, type of call and parties involved)
- Be aware of any persons or vehicles in or leaving the crime scene. Remain alert and attentive 
- Approach the scene cautiously, scan the entire area, and note any possible secondary crime scenes 
- Make initial observation (look, listen, smell) to assess the scene and ensure officer safety before proceeding 
- Treat the location as a crime scene until it has been assessed and determined to be otherwise 

## 2.) Follow Safety Procedures 
Officers must identify any individual situations or people, to keep themselves and other individuals safe. The responding officers should :
- Ensure that there is no immediate threat to other responders - scan the area for sights, sounds or smells that may present danger
- Approach the scene in a manner that maximizes the safety of victims, witnesses, officers and others in the area
- Survey the scene for potential suspects and control the situation
- Notify supervisory personnel and call for assistance / backup 

## 3.) Provide for Emergency care 
Officers should ensure that medical attention is provided to injured people, and minimize contamination of the scene. The responding officers should : 
- Assess the victims for signs of life and medical need and provide immediate medical attention 
- Guide medical personnel to the victim to minimize contamination or alteration of the crime scene 
- Point out potential physical evidences to medical personnel and instruct them to minimize contact with such evidences and to avoid moving or altering items originating from the scene 
- Document movement of persons or items by medical personnel 
- Obtain the name, unit and telephone number of attending medical personnel, and the name and location of the medical facility where the victims are to be taken 
- It the victim or suspect is transported to a medical facility, send law enforcement official with the victim or suspect to document any comments made and preserve evidence 
- If no officers are available to accompany the victim / suspect, stay at the scene and ask medical personnel to perform this task 
- If there is a chance the victim may die, attempt to obtain a dying declaration or a statement about the circumstances surrounding his or her impending death 

### Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault 
- If a drug-facilitated sexual assault is suspected, it is critical that a urine sample be collected 
- efforts should be made to add this step to the forensic examination procedure 
- Not all hospitals and forensic examination facilities have sexual assault evidence kits and even when they do, many such kits may be incomplete in terms of collection devices and appropriate containers 
- It is critical that law enforcement work to establish protocols to address their response to illegal substance use on the part of the victim (which may come to light as a result of urine of blood testing) so that it does not compromise a sexual assault investigation 
- It is better to conduct a thorough investigation of a sexual assault crime than to prosecute victims for crime violations (driving under the influence, underage drinking, being under the influence of a narcotic drug)

## 4.) Secure and Control people at the crime scene 
Officers should control, identify and remove people from the scene. The responding officers should :
- Prevent individuals from altering or destroying physical evidence by restricting movement, location, and activity while ensuring and maintaining safety at the scene 
- Document any statement / comments made by victims, suspects or witnesses at the scene
- Exclude unauthorized personnel from the scene (e.g. law enforcement personnel not working on the case, politicians and media)

## 5.) Identify, Establish, Protect and Secure Boundaries 
- Offices can protect and secure a crime scene by defining and controlling boundaries 
- Boundaries should be expanded beyond the initial scope of the crime scene as it can be reduced in size if necessary

The responding officers should :
- Establish the scene boundaries, starting at the focal point and extending outwards to include
	- where the crime occurred 
	- potential paths of exit and entry of suspects and witnesses 
	- Places where the victim / evidences may have been moved 
- Set up physical barriers (e.g. ropes, cones, crime scene barrier tape, available vehicles, personnel, other equipment) or use existing boundaries (e.g. doors, walls and gates)
- Document the entry / exit of all people entering and leaving the scene, once boundaries have been established 
- Control the flow of personnel and animals entering and leaving the scene
- Preserve and protect evidence that may be lost or compromised (e.g. protect from the weather, footsteps, tire tracks and sprinklers)
- document the original location of the victim or objects that you observe being moved 
- If necessary obtain consent to search and/or obtain a search warrant 

## 6.) Turn over control of the scene and brief the investigators in charge 
The responding officers should :
- Brief the investigators taking charge
- Assist in controlling the scene
- Turn over responsibility for the documentation of entries and exits from the scene 
- Remain at the scene until your'e relieved from duty

## 7.) Document actions and Observations 
Officers should create a permanent record of all activities conducted and observations made as soon as possible after the event 

The responding officers should document :
- Observations of the crime scene, including the location of persons and items within the crime and the appearances and conditions of the scene upon arrival
- Condition on arrival (e.g., lights: on/off; shades: up/down; open/closed; doors and windows: open/closed; smells; liquids; movable furniture; weather; temperature; and personal items.)
- Personal information / statement from  witnesses, victims or suspects 
- Actions by the officers and others present
