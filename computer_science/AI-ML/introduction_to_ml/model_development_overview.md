Breaking down the machine learning model development process : 
1. Define the Problem
	- Identify the objectives
		- desired outcomes
	- e.g. predicting loan approvals or classifying email spam
2. Data Collection
	- Gather relevant data from various sources 
3. Data Exploration and Preproceesing
	- Explore the data to understand it's structure, spot outliers, and handle missing values 
	- Preprocess it by normalizing, encoding, or scaling
4. Feature Engineering
	- Extract or create new features to improve the model's performance 
5. Model Selection
	- Choose the right algorithm (e.g. logistic regression, random forest, neural networks)
6. Model training
	- split data into training and testing sets, train the model, and optimize hyperparameters
7. Model Evaluation
	- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or confusion matrix
8. Model Deployment
	- Prepare the model for deployment in production
9. Bias Detection and Model Monitoring
	- Analyze the model for fairness, bias, and drift over time
