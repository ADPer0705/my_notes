TensorFlow is a more complex library for distributed numerical computation. It makes it possible to train and run very large neural networks efficiently by distributing the computation across potentially hundreds of multi-GPU servers. TensorFlow (TF) was created at Google and supports many of its large-scale Machine Learning applications. It was open sourced in November 2015, and version 2.0 was released in September 2019
