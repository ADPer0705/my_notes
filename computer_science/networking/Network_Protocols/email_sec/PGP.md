**PRETTY GOOD SECURITY** is designed for *securing email*. It was developed by Phil Zimmermann. 
- Earlier it was open product but later it was converted to low-cost commercial product 
- It provides 
	- privacy
	- integrity
	- authentication 
	- non-repudiation 
	to emails
- Integrity, authentication and non-repudiation are provided with the help of digital signature 
- confidentiality is ensured using asymmetric key encryption 

In PGP, raw attachment files are first encrypted with the public key of the receiver, before sending. On receiving, the attachment files are decrypted with the private key of the receiver

PGP verifies the information of the sender, to ensure that the email was not intercepted by a third party. All sensitive information is always protected. No one from the internet can view it and steal it. 
PGP ensures that the information which has been sent from the sender side has been received on the receiver side, without any change and no modification has been done in between. 
PGP ensures that the files once deleted, cannot be recovered later.
