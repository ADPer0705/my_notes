# The Goal of Disaster Recovery
*Disaster Recovery*, in information security terms, are the activities necessary to restore IT and communication services to an organization during and after an outage, disruption or disturbance of any kind or scale 
*Disaster Recovery Plan* : The processes, policies, and procedures related to preparing for recovery or continuation of an organization's critical business functions, technology, infrastructure, systems and applications after the organization experiences a disaster. A *disaster* is when an organization's critical business functions cannot be performed at an acceptable level within a predetermined period following a disruption 

# Disaster Recovery in Real World
We need to make sure that an organization’s critical systems are formally identified and have backups that are regularly tested. Sometimes an incident is not recognized or detected until days or months later

# Components of a Disaster Recovery Plans
Depending on the size of the organization and the number of people involved in the DRP effort, organizations often maintain multiple types of plan documents, intended for different audiences.

The following list includes various types of documents worth considering:

- Executive summary providing a high-level overview of the plan
- Department-specific plans
- Technical guides for IT personnel responsible for implementing and maintaining critical backup systems
- Full copies of the plan for critical disaster recovery team members
- Checklists for certain individuals:
	- Critical disaster recovery team members will have checklists to help guide their actions amid the chaotic atmosphere of a disaster.
	- IT personnel will have technical guides helping them get the alternate sites up and running. 
	- Managers and public relations personnel will have simple-to-follow, high-level documents to help them communicate the issue accurately without requiring input from team members who are busy working on the recovery
