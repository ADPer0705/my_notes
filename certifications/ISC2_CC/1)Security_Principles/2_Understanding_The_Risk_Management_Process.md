- organisations often fail to proactively manage risk
- assessing and analyzing risk should be a continuous and comprehensive exercise
- As a member of an organization’s security team, you will work through risk assessment, analysis, mitigation, remediation and communication

There are many frameworks and models used to facilitate the risk management process and each organization makes its own determination of what constitutes risk and the level or risk it is willing to take, however there are commonalities among the lines of terminology, concepts and skills

*Risk* is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by potential circumstance or event. It is often expressed as a combination of :
1. the likelihood of occurrence 
2. The adverse impacts that would arise upon occurrence

*Information Security risk* reflects the potential adverse impacts that result from the possibility of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction of information and/or information systems

# Risk Management Terminology
Security professionals use their knowledge and skills to examine operational risk management, determine how to use risk data effectively, work cross-functionally and report actionable information and findings to the stakeholders concerned

Most cybersecurity professionals are familiar with the following terms :
- An *asset* is something in need of protection 
- A *vulnerability* is a gap or weakness in an organisation's protection of its valuable assets, including information 
- A *threat* is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to thwart protection efforts or gain unauthorized access
risk is the intersection of these terms

# Risk Identification
Identifying risks is a recurring process of identifying different possible risks, characterizing them and then estimating their potential for disrupting the organisation ![[Screenshot from 2024-03-15 21-18-42.png]]

# likelihood
when determining an organisation's vulnerabilities, the security team will consider the *probability* or *likelihood*, of a potential vulnerability being exploited within the construct of the organization's threat environment.
- *probability* The chances, of likelihood, that a given threat is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability or a set of vulnerabilities. (NIST SP 800-30Rev1)
- *likelihood* The probability that a potential vulnerability may be exercised within the construct of the associated threat environment 

*Likelihood of occurrence* 
- A weighted factor based on a subjective analysis of the probability that a given threat is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability or a set of vulnerabilities

finally the likely result upon the occurrence of an event is realized,
*Impact*
- is the magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the consequence of unauthorized disclosure of information, unauthorized modification of information, unauthorized destruction of information, or loss of information or information system availability 
- In short, it is the magnitude of harm that could be caused by threat's exercise of a vulnerability

# Risk Assessment
*Risk Management* is defined as the process of identifying, estimating and prioritizing risks to an organisation's operations (including it's mission, function, image and reputation), assets, individuals, other organisations and even the nation.
- The analysis performed as part of risk management which incorporates threat and vulnerability analysis and considers mitigation provided by security controls planned or in place
Risk assessment should result in aligning (or associating) each identified risk resulting from the operation of an information system with the goals, objectives, assets or processes that the organisation uses, which in turn aligns with of directly supports achieving the organisation's goals and objectives 

A risk assessment system can prioritize the the items or activities for risk mitigation for management to determine the method of mitigation that best suits the assets being protected
- fire prevention system example
	- fire alarms don't prevent fire but warns
	- sprinklers don't stop fire but reduces the damage, but in case of a data center, a gas based system wouldn't harm the servers and the data within those servers, but would be costly

The result of risk assessment is a report submitted to given management for their use, and is provided to management for review and approval, upon which a more in-depth or detailed risk assessment might be suggested as required

# Risk Treatment 
It relates to making decisions about the best actions to take regarding the identified and prioritized risk
- The determination of the best way to address an identified risk
The decision made are independent of the attitude of management towards risk and the availability - and cost - of risk mitigation.

The options commonly used to respond to risk are :
- Avoidance 
- Acceptance 
- Mitigation
- Transfer

## Avoidance 
It is the decision to attempt to eliminate the risk entirely. This could include ceasing the operation for some or all the activities of the organisation that are exposed to a particular risk.

Organisation leadership may choose risk avoidance when
- The potential impact is too high
- likelihood of the risk being realized is simply too great

## Acceptance 
It is taking no action to reduce the likelihood of a risk occurring. Management may opt for conducting the business function that is associated with the risk without any further action on the part of the organisation, either because 
- The likelihood of occurrence is negligible 
- the benefit is more than enough to offset the risk

## Mitigation
it is the most common type of risk management and includes reducing the possibility of a risk event or its impact.

Risk mitigation may involve remediation measures, or controls, such as security controls, establishing policies, procedures and standards to minimize adverse risk

Risk cannot always be mitigated but mitigations such as safety measures should always be in place

## Transfer
Risk transference is the practice of passing the risk to another party, who will accept the financial impact of the harm resulting from a risk being realized in exchange for payment 
- Typically, this is an insurance policy

# Risk Priorities 
upon identification, it is time to prioritize and analyse core risks through 
- *qualitative risk analysis* A method for risk analysis that is based on the assignment of a descriptor such as low, medium of high (NISTIR 8286)
- *quantitative risk analysis* A method of risk analysis where numerical values are assigned to both impact and likelihood based on statistical probabilities and monetarized valuation of risk or gain (NISTIR 8286)
This is necessary to determine root cause and narrow down apparent risks and core risks

The one shown above is a common tool for risk assessment and prioritizing 

## Decision making based on risk priorities 
when making decisions based on risk priorities, organisations must evaluate the likelihood and impact of risk as well as their tolerance for different sorts of risks. If a company chooses to ignore or accept the risk, exposing the workers to  asbestos, for example, it puts the company in a position of tremendous liability.

# Decision Making  Based on Risk Priorities 
- When making decision based on risk priorities, organisations must evaluate the likelihood and impact of the risk as well as their tolerance for different sorts of risk 
- e.g. a company in Hawaii is more concerned about the risk of a volcanic eruption than a company in chicago, which on the other hand would have to plan for blizzards 
- In these cases determining risk tolerance is upto the executive management and the board of directors 

---
# Risk Tolerance
The perception management takes towards risk is often likened to the entity's appetite for risk 
- *Risk Tolerance* is the level of risk an entity is willing to assume in order to achieve a potential desired result (NIST SP 800-32) 
- Risk Threshold, risk appetite and acceptable risk are also terms used synonymously with risk tolerance 
The level of risk tolerance varies across organisations, and even internally amongst the various departments 

Understanding the organisation and senior management's attitude towards risk is usually the starting point for getting management to take actions regarding risks

Executive management and/or the Board of Directors determines what is an acceptable level of risk for the organization. Security professionals aim to maintain the levels of risk within management’s limit of risk tolerance

examples of volcanoes erupting and power outages in data centers, no of generators depends upon the risk tolerance
