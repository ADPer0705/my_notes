Offensive security is the process of breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access to them. To beat a hacker one needs to behave like a hacker, finding vulnerabilities and recommending patches before a cyber-criminal does 

On the flip side there is also defensive security, which is the process of protecting an organisation's network and computer systems by analyzing and securing any potential digital threats. In a defensive security role, you could be investigating infected computers or devices to understand how it was hacked, tracking down cyber-criminals, or monitoring infrastructure for malicious activity
