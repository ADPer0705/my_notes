# Some basic Definitions 
---
These terms refers to the variations or arrangements of atoms and nuclei within the realm of chemistry and physics 

==**Isotones**== : Atoms of the same element (i.e. same number of protons) but different numbers of neutrons 
e.g. C-12 and C-14

==**Isobars**== : Atoms or ions with the same mass number but different atomic number 
e.g. C-14 and N-14

==**Isotones**== : Nuclei with the same number of neutrons 
e.g.

==**Isomers**== : Nuclei with the same number of protons and neutrons but different energy states 
e.g.

==**Allotropes**== : Different structural forms of the same physical element in the same physical state 
e.g. diamond and graphite

# Data

There are three subatomic particles :
1. Electrically positive ==Protons==
	- Mass = 1.67 x 10$^{-24}$ g
	- charge = +1.6 x 10$^{-19}$ C
	- Relative mass = 1.007 u
2. Electrically neutral ==neutrons==
	- Mass = 1.67 x 10$^{-24}$ g
	- Relative mass = 1.009 u
1. Electrically negative ==Electrons==
	- Mass = 9.1 x 10$^{-28}$ g
	- charge = -1.6 x 10$^{-19}$ C
	- Relative mass = 0.0005 u
