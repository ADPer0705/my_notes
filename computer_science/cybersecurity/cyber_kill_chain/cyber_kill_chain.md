Lockheed Martin, a global aerospace and security company established the Cyber Kill Chain framework for the cybersecurity industry in 2011 based on the military concept.

Following are the attack phases :
1. Reconnaissance
	- Gather information about the target 
	- this can involve scanning for vulnerabilities, researching employee details, and identifying weaknesses in defense
	  
2. Weaponization
	- create malware tailored to exploit the vulnerabilities 
	- often includes packaging the malware with a payload and create a mechanism to deliver it  
3. Delivery
	- transmitting the weaponized payload to the target 
	- this stage is the most visible as security teams focus on intercepting suspicious emails or files
	   
4. Exploitation
	- the malware exploits the vulnerabilities on the system 
	  
5. Installation
	- now the attackers install malware on the system, establishing a back door or persistent access
	  
6. Command and Control (C2)
	- With the malware installed the attackers establishes a communication channel between the compromised system and their C2 server, enabling them to issue commands, upload data, and control the system
	  
7. Actions on Objectives 
	- in the final phase, the attackers carry out their intended goals
