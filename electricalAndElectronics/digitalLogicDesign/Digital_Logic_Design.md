# Digital Systems 
Most of the modern digital devices have a special-purpose digital computer embedded in them. The most striking property of the digital computer is its *generality*
- It can follow a sequence of instructions, called a program, that operates on given data. 
- The user can specify or change the data according to the specific need. 
Because of this flexibility, general-purpose digital computers can perform a variety of information-processing tasks that range over a wide spectrum of applications 

One characteristic of digital system is their ability to represent and manipulate discrete elements of information. 
- Any set that is restricted to a finite number of elements contains a discrete information
Early digital computers were used for numeric computations
- in this case the discrete elements were the digits 
- From this application, the term *digital computer* emerged
Discrete elements of information are represented in a digital system bu physical quantities called *signals* 
- electrical signals such as voltages and current are most common 
- electronic devices called transistors predominate in the circuitry that implements these signals 
- the signals in most present-day electronic digital systems use just two discrete values and are therefore said to be binary 
	- discrete elements of information are represented with *groups of bits* called *binary codes*
- Through various techniques, groups of bits can be made of bits can be made to represent a discrete symbols, not necessarily numbers, which are then used to develop the system in a digital format. 
	- Thus a **digital system** is a system that manipulates discrete elements of information represented internally in binary form
	- In today's technology, binary systems are most practical because they can be implemented with electronic components 

Discrete quantities of information emerge from 
- the nature of the data being processed or 
- may be quantized from a continuous process 
	On the one hand, a payroll schedule is an inherently discrete process that contains employee names, social security numbers, weekly salaries, income taxes, and so on. An employeeâ€™s paycheck is processed by means of discrete data values such as letters of the alphabet (names), digits (salary), and special symbols (such as $). On the other hand, a research scientist may observe a continuous process, but record only specific quantities in tabular form. The scientist is thus quantifying continuous data, making each number in his or her table a discrete quantity
In many cases, the quantization of a process can be performed automatically by an *analog-to-digital converter*
-  A device that forms a digital (discrete) representation of a analog (continuous) quantity

A digital computer is a powerful instrument that can perform not only arithmetic computations, but also logical operations
- In addition it can be programmed to make decisions based on internal and external conditions 
- There are fundamental reasons that commercial products are made with digital circuits 
	- Like digital computers, digital devices are programmable 
	- By changing the program in a programmable device, the same underlying hardware can be used for many different application, thereby allowing its cost of development to be spread across a wider customer base
	- As the number of transistors that can be put on a piece of silicon increases to produce complex functions, the cost per unit decreases and digital devices can be bought at an increasingly reduced price 
- Equipment made with digital integrated circuits can perform at a speed of hundreds of millions of operations per second 
- Digital systems can be made to operate with extreme reliability by using error-detecting codes 

A digital system is an interconnection of digital modules 
- to understand the operations of each digital module, it is necessary to have a basic knowledge of  digital circuits and their logical functions
