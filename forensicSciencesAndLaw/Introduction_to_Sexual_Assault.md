- Sexual Assault is any unwanted sexual act (verbal, visual, or physical) done by one person to another 
- Assault does not necessarily have to be an act of penetration, it can include both fondling and molestation as well
- Sexual assault is considered rape when it involves oral, anal, or vaginal penetration
- It is also considered an assault if inflicted upon a person who is incapable of giving consent because of age, physical incapacity, or mental incapacity

- Sexual assault is considered a heinous crime and points to the beastly nature of society as a whole 
- It is also breaches the most revered fundamental rights of the individual, namely the right to life mentioned in *Article 21* of the Indian constitution 
- The fundamental reason for this violation is to spoil a woman's dignity

#### Trauma 
- Sexual assault in any form has numerous physical and emotional implications on the lives of victims and their family members 
- While some woman are able to handle the rape experience effectively in a timely manner, most woman report psychological symptoms, which were not present prior to the rape 
- It is necessary to tackle such situation with the emotional, physical and cultural elements of rape and its consequences 

## Major Causes of Sexual Victimization 
Though we live in the 21st century, the fear of isolation and humiliation still haunts the victims of sexual assault and as a result many cases go unreported 

The three causes of rape are :
- Victim Precipitation 
	- A controversial theory asserting that victim's actions, dress and conduct lead to their harm of loss
- Pathology
	- An obsession for Sex
- Hostility
	- hostile, distressful, insecure feelings towards people, particularly women
	- a desire to control and dominate women

Causes 
- A lack of information on how to avoid situation that is favorable to rape 
- Experimentation with drugs and alcohol by 25% of all college students leads to poor judgement, and is one of the top causes of rape on college campuses
- Prior sexual and physical abuse (either observed or experienced within the family) affects both the victim and aggressor
- The fact that very few rapes (only 42%) get reported empowers the rapists, who then go on to commit more crimes
- Another possible cause of date rape can be linked to traditional "sex-roles" that includes the premise that the man makes the first move toward having sex. Men are naturally dominant and aggressive


## Reasons For Paralyzed Access to Justice 
Though we talk about the improvement in criminal investigation with the help of forensic science, 100% conviction of the accused is not yet achieved because of paralyzed access to justice

Reasons :
1. Rape myths: (woman’s dress/ behaviour/ character was the cause)
2. Social stigma (blaming the victim)
3. Lack of support services
4. Lack of protection for victims and witnesses
5. Inadequate investigations by the police
6. Problematic medical examinations
7. Gaps in the law
8. Protracted court proceedings

#### Reluctance 
Reasons why victims of sexual assault are not willing to cooperate during an investigation

- Women may care about the perpetrator and believe he will change
- Destruction of self-confidence can prevent women from seeking help
- They may want or feel forced to maintain the ‘norm’ of the family
- Women may believe it is their fault
-  Women may be too frightened to leave the perpetrator
- Worries of unsympathetic treatment from police and discomforting procedures
-  Lack of belief in the police’s ability to apprehend the suspect
-  Fear of further victimization by court proceedings (a result of television programs or newspaper reports)
-  Embarrassment about publicity, however limited
-  Fear of reprisal by the rapist
