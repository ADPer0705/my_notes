when you visit a website, your browser makes a request to a web server asking for information about the page you're visiting. It will respond with data that you browser uses to show you the page; a web server is just a dedicated computer somewhere else in the world that handles your requests

There are two major components that makes up a website : 
1. Front End (Client side) : The way your browser renders a website
2. Back End (Server side) : a server that processes your requests and returns a response

websites are primarily created using 
- [[HTML]]
	- to build websites and define their structure
- [[CSS]]
	- to make website look pretty by adding styling options
- [[JavaScript]]
	- implement complex features on pages interactively
