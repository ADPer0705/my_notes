Perpetrators prefer not to interact with the victim directly and, instead, they will create a "weaponizer" that, according to Lockheed Martin, combines **malware** and **exploit** into a deliverable **payload**. Most attackers usually use automated tools to generate the malware or refer to the [DarkWeb](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/deep-web) to purchase the malware. More sophisticated actors or nation-sponsored APT (Advanced Persistent Threat Groups) would write their custom malware to make the malware sample uniqueÂ and evade detection on the target

- _Malware_ is a program or software that is designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer
- *Exploit* is a program or a code that takes advantage of the vulnerability of flaw in the application or system
- *payload* is a malicious code that the attacker runs on the system

*macro* is referred to as a group of commands that perform a specific task. You can think of them as subroutines or functions that contain the code that most users use to automate routine tasks. But malicious actors tend to use them for malicious purposes and, say for example, include them in Microsoft Office documents
