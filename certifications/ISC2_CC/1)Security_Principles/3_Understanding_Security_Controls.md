# What are Security Controls?
- *Security Controls* : The management operational and technical controls (i.e. safeguard or countermeasures) prescribed for an information systems to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system and its information (FIPS PUB 199)
The implementation of controls should reduce risk, hopefully to an acceptable level 

## Physical Controls 
- Controls implemented through a tangible mechanism. 
- e.g. walls, fences, guards, locks, etc.
- In modern organizations many physical control systems are linked to technical / logical systems, such as badge readers connected to door locks 
Basically, it addresses process-based security needs using physical hardware devices, such as badge readers, architectural features of buildings and facilities, and specific security actions to be taken by people 

They typically provide ways of controlling, directing or preventing the movement of people and equipment throughout a specific physical location. In most situations, physical controls are supported by technical controls as a means of incorporating them into an overall security system 

Visitors and guests accessing a workplace, for example, must often enter the facility through a designated entrance and exit, where they can be identified, their visitâ€™s purpose assessed, and then allowed or denied entry. Employees would enter, perhaps through other entrances, using company-issued badges or other tokens to assert their identity and gain access. These require technical controls to integrate the badge or token readers, the door release mechanisms and the identity management and access control systems into a more seamless security system.

## Technical Controls 
- aka logical controls 
- security controls for an information system that are primarily implemented and executed by the information system through mechanisms contained in the hardware, software or firmware components of the system 

The are the security controls that computer systems and networks directly implement. These controls provide automated protection from unauthorized access or misuse, facilitate detection of security violations and support security requirements stored as data, managed through a software graphical user interface (GUI), or they can be hardware settings done with switches, jumper plugs or other means.

The implementation of technical controls always requires significant operational considerations and should be consistent with the management of security within the organisation 

## Administrative Controls 
- aka managerial controls 
- Controls implemented through policy and procedures 
- e.g. access control processes and requiring multiple personnel to conduct a specific operation 
- Administrative controls in modern environments are often enforced in conjunction with physical and / or technical controls, such as an access-granting policy for new users that requires login and approval by the hiring managers

These are directives, guidelines or advisories aimed at the people within the organization. They provide frameworks, constraint and standards for human behavior, and should cover the entire scope of the organization's activities and its interactions with external parties and stakeholders 

It is vitally important to realize that administrative controls can and should be powerful, effective tools for achieving information security, if the organisation fully implements them through systematic training and practice
