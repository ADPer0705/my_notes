When one machine sends data to another machine, 
- the physical addresses of the sender and receiver are placed in a frame header. 
- The data frame carries the sender and receiverâ€™s physical address. When the data moves from one network to other, 
- the physical address changes hop to hop throughout the communication path.
- The logical address remains the same throughout the path
	- it identifies the sender and receiver machines in a multi-network path
