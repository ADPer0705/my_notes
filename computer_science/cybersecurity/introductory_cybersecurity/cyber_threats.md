before learning about cyber-attacks, we should know about threats and vulnerabilities, which play an important role for the attackers to choose your machine or network as an attack target.

- **Threats** 
	- are circumstances or events that can possibly harm a computer by 
		- destroying it, 
		- disclosing the information stored in a system, 
		- harmfully modifying data, or 
		- making the system unavailable.
	- e.g. the computer might have a malware attack, is a threat
- **Vulnerabilities**
	- weakness in an information system or its components that could be exploited.
	- e.g. Using an older version of TLS certificate for the security of your website is a vulnerability 

A **cyber-attack** is any attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer, computing system or computer network with the intent to cause damage.
- They aim to
	- disable
	- disrupt 
	- destroy
	- control
	computer system or to 
	- modify 
	- block
	- delete
	- manipulate
	- steal
	the data held within these systems

The complete process, an attacker follows to reach to your machines and attack them for stealing information is called **cyber-kill chain**

this includes 7 steps used by an attacker 
1. **Reconnaissance**
	- the attacker chooses their target and conduct  an in-depth research of it, to identify the vulnerabilities that can be exploited
2. **Weaponization**
	- the intruder creates a *malware weapon* like a virus, worm or preparing a phishing website etc. in order to exploit the vulnerabilities of the target 
3. **Delivery**
	- when the weapon is transmitted to the target 
	- The intruder / attacker can employ different methods like USB drives, e-mail attachments and websites for this purpose 
4. **Exploitation**
	- the malware starts the action
	- The program code of malware is triggered to exploit the target's vulnerability 
5. **Installation**
	- the malware installs an access point
	- the access point is also known *backdoor* for the intruder / attacker
6. **Command and Control** (C2)
	- the malware gives the intruder / attacker access in the network / system. 
7. **Actions on Objectives**
	- After getting the command of the system, the attacker finally takes action to fulfill its purpose 
	- such as 
		- encryption for ransom
		- data exfiltration 
		- data destruction 
		etc.

Following are some of the common cyber-attacks 
- **Phishing**
	- the most common attacks 
	- it can target any individual who is not alert 
	- it can be implemented using malicious links included in emails , social media sites, etc.
	- phishing refers to the practice of creating fake emails of SMS that appears to come from someone you trust
- **Identity Threat**
	- here the identity of an individual may be stolen to commit frauds such as bank related frauds
	- This is achieved by stealing your personal identification details like adhar number, PAN number, passwords, etc.
- **Man in the Middle Attack**
	- here the attacker relays and possibly alters communication between two parties who believe they are communicating directly
	- The allows attackers to relay communication, listen in, and even modify what each party is saying 
	- allows an attacker to steal the information being flown from one user to another 
	- This can be implemented inside the local network or the internet using various free tools and techniques 
- **Password Stealing**
	- allows the attacker to unauthorizedly steal the password of the users
	- The password can be stolen using 
		- the credentials stuffing methods in which attackers use lists of compromised user credentials to breach into a system or 
		- use a key-logger software or hardware capable of recording input 
		- It can also be done using a dictionary attack method of breaking into a password-protected computer, network or other IT resources by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password 
		- *social engineering*
			- it is the art of manipulating, influencing, or deceiving you in order to gain control over your computer system
			- The hacker might use the phone, email, snail mail, or direct contact to gain illegal access 
		- A password spraying attack is also a type of brute force attack where a malicious actor attempts the same password on many accounts before moving on to another one and repeating the process 
			- This is effective because people use simple, predictable passwords like "password123"
- **Denial Of Service** (DOS)
	- aims to make the resources of information unavailable to the user 
	- here, a computer sends a massive amount of traffic to a victim's computer and shuts it down. 
	- A DoS attack is an online attack that is used to make the website unavailable for its users when done on a website 
	- In DDoS attacks, (distributed denial of service), dos attacks are executed from many different locations using many systems
