J.J. Thompson and E. Rutherford (England ~1990) established a model of the atom, which became the basis of the modern atomic theory 

There are three subatomic particles :
1. Electrically positive ==Protons==
	- Mass = 1.67 x 10$^{-24}$ g
	- charge = +1.6 x 10$^{-19}$ C
	- Relative mass = 1.007 u
2. Electrically neutral ==neutrons==
	- Mass = 1.67 x 10$^{-24}$ g
	- Relative mass = 1.009 u
1. Electrically negative ==Electrons==
	- Mass = 9.1 x 10$^{-28}$ g
	- charge = -1.6 x 10$^{-19}$ C
	- Relative mass = 0.0005 u

# Atomic Composition
- The Atom is mostly empty space 
- protons and neutrons in the nucleus and electrons in the orbit around the nucleus 
- In an electrically neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons 
# Atomic Number 
- It is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. 
- It is denoted by '==Z==' 
- All the atoms of the same element have the same atomic number 
# Mass Number 
- It is the mass of the atom 
- Since the mass of the proton and the neutron is approximately the same and is considered as 1 u , and the mass of the electron is negligible, the mass number also indicates the sum of the total number of protons and the neutrons in the nucleus 
- 1 u = 1.661 x 10$^{-24}$ g
- It is denoted by '==A==' = no of protons + no of neutrons ![[atomicsymbol.jpg | center | 200 ]]
