The image below represents the classification of the properties of matter 

![[Screenshot 2024-02-20 122138.jpg]]


Both physical and Chemical properties of matter are either intensive or extensive 

| **INTENSIVE PROPERTIES** | **EXTENSIVE PROPERTIES** |
| ---- | ---- |
| An Intensive property is a bulk property, which means it is a system's local physical property that is independent of the system's size or volume of material.  | A property that is dependent on the amount of matter in a sample is known as an extensive property  |
| e.g. Pressure, Temperature, colour, melting and boiling point,, etc. | e.g. Mass, volume, etc. |
**remark :**  The scale of the system or the volume of matter present in it determines the  extensive property of the system. Extensive property are those in which the value of a system's property is equal to the sum of the value for the parts of the system

## Laws of Chemical Combination

There are the following laws of chemical combination
1. law of conservation of mass
	- Antoine Lavoisier (France 1789)
	- mass can neither be created nor be destroyed 
	- during a chemical reaction the sum of the masses of the reactants and the products remains same and unchanged 
	    i.e. Total mass of the products remains equal to the total mass of the reactants 
	    e.g. 
		    H$_2$ + Cl$_2$ ---> 2HCl
2. law of constant composition 
     - Joseph Proust (France 1799)
     - In a chemical compound the elements are always present in a definite proportion by mass, irrespective the source of the substance 
     - e.g. consider H$_2$O, contains H and O in the ration $1 : 8$. If 9 grams of water is decomposed we get 1g H and 9g O  
3. law of multiple proportions 
	 - John Dalton (England)
	 - the mass of one element which combines with the fixed mass of the others, bears a simple whole number ratio to one another 
	 - e.g.  
		The ration of Oxygen combining with 14 parts of Nitrogen is 
         $8 : 16 : 24 : 32 : 40$ ===> $1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5$

| N$_2$O | $14 : 8$ |
| ---- | ---- |
| NO | $14 : 16$ |
| N$_2$O$_3$ | $14 : 24$ |
| N$_2$O$_4$ | $14 : 32$ |
| N$_2$O$_5$ | $14 : 40$ |
4. law of reciprocal proportions 
5. Law of combining volumes 
	- Gay Lussac's law of gaseous volumes
	- the ration between the volumes of the reactant gases and the product gases can be expressed in a simple whole number

## Dalton's Atomic Theory

- from 1803
- basis of today's chemistry 
- theory consists of six parts 
	1. Matter is made up of indivisible particles called atoms
	2. Atoms can never be created nor be destroyed in a chemical reaction
	3. Atom of the same element are similar with respect to shape, size and mass
	4. Atoms of different elements have different masses and properties 
	5. Atoms combine in small whole number ratios to form compounds 
	6. Atoms of two  elements may combine in different ratios to form more than one compound ![[Screenshot 2024-02-20 130557.jpg]]

- Limitations  of Dalton's Atomic Theory
	1. Atoms of the same or different types have a strong tendency to combine together to form a new 'group of atoms', which indicates that the smallest unit capable of independent existence is not an atom, but a 'group of atoms'. so it didn't explain causes of chemical combination and law of combining volumes
	2. With the discovery of sub atomic particles like electrons, neutrons and protons, the atom can no longer be considered indivisible 
	3. discovery of isotopes indicates that all atoms of the same element are not perfectly identical. 

## Modern Atomic Theory 
1. Atom is Divisible
2. same atom may have different atomic masses like $^1$H, $^2$H and $^3$H.
3. Different atoms may have same atomic mass like $^{40}$Ca and $^{40}$Ar
4. Atom is the smallest particle that takes place in a chemical reaction 
5. The mass of an atom can be changed into energy

## Avogadro's Hypothesis 
The law is named after Amedeo Avogadro (Italy 1811)

It is a gas law which states that, under the same conditions of temperature and pressure equal volumes of all gases contain the same number of molecules, which is thus independent of their size of the molar mass of the gas
